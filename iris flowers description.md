#### The iris setosa
See [Iris setosa description](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iris_setosa&oldid=858265829).

- The Iris setosa has *mid-green* leaves, which are *grass-like*, and lanceolate (sword-shaped).   
- They have a *purplish tinged base* and the leaves can measure *30–60 cm long by 0.8–2.5 cm wide*.  
- The plant has 3–4 flowers per stem (between 6 and 13 for the whole plant,in groups of 3, and it blooms between June and July.
- The large flowers are between 5–8 cm across,usually 7–8 cm, and come in a range of shades of blue, which can depend on the location. and range from violet, purple-blue, violet-blue, blue,to lavender. Very occasionally, there are pink or white forms.
- Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. 
- The sepals can be deeply veined dark purple with a yellow-white signal (centre). 
- The standards are so small, that they are reduced to bristles.Which gives the flower, a flat, three petal appearance

### The Iris versicolor 
see [iris versicolor description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_versicolor)

- The *Iris versicolor* is a species of Iris native to North America, in the Eastern United States and Eastern Canada
- Iris versicolor is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant, growing 10–80 cm high. 
- It tends to form large clumps from thick, creeping rhizomes. 
- The unwinged, erect stems generally have basal leaves that are more than 1 cm wide. 
- Leaves are folded on the midribs so that they form an overlapping flat fan. 
- The well developed blue flower has 6 petals and sepals spread out nearly flat and have two forms. 
- The longer sepals are hairless and have a greenish-yellow blotch at their base. The inferior ovary is bluntly angled. 
- Flowers are usually light to deep blue (purple and violet are not uncommon)

### The Iris Virginica
see [iris virginica description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_virginica)
The plant has 2 to 4 *erect* or arching, *bright green, lance-shaped* leaves that are flattened into one plane at the base. 
- Leaves are *1–3 cm* wide and are sometimes longer than the flower stalk. 
- The slightly fragrant flowers (4 cm long, 7 cm across) consist of 3 horizontal sepals, or "falls", and 3 erect petals. 
- The petals and sepals can vary in color from dark-violet to pinkish-white. 
- The sepals have a splash of yellow to yellow-orange at the crest. 
- Each plant has 2 to 6 flowers that bloom from April to May upon a single, erect, 30–90 cm tall stalk. 
- The stalk is sometimes branched and has a slight zigzag appearance.
