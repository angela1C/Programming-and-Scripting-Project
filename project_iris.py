# ### Background Information about the Iris Data Set
# 
# [UCI Iris Data Set Information](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) states that Fisher's iris dataset is possibly the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature and Fisher's paper is frequently referenced to this day. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other two which are not linearly separable from each other.

# [Wikipedia - Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher)
# >Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher FRS[3] (17 February 1890 â€“ 29 July 1962) was a British statistician and geneticist. For his work in statistics, he has been described as "a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science"[4] and "the single most important figure in 20th century statistics".
# 
# Fisher developed ANOVA, the Analysis of Variance. He used it to analyse data from crop experiments. He also developed the Fisher Distribution. He pioneered the principles of the design of experiments and the statistics of small samples and the analysis of real data.
# 
# In 1936 Fisher introduced the Iris flower data set as an example of discriminant analysis. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant, a method used in statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier.
# 
# [Wikipedia - Iris Flower Data Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)
# The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset consisting of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

# ### LOADING THE IRIS DATA SET
# Next read in the Iris data set that is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
# The data is available in a csv format. 
# 
# The Iris Data Set is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. According to the Data Set listing, it is a multivariate data set and the default machine learning task is classification. The attribute types are real numbers. It has 150 instances with 5 attributes. The data set was donated in 1988 by Michael Marshall but the data set was created by R.A. Fisher.

# https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data
# 
# The actual data set itself at the UCI Machine Learning repository does not have the attribute information included in the csv file. However this information can be found under the section [Iris Data Set: Attribute Information](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.names)
# 
#  Attribute Information:
#    1. sepal length in cm
#    2. sepal width in cm
#    3. petal length in cm
#    4. petal width in cm
#    5. class: 
#       -- Iris Setosa
#       -- Iris Versicolour
#       -- Iris Virginica
#       
#       
# The python `pandas` library is designed for working with tabular or heteogenous data, i.e. data that is in a tabular format containing an ordered collection of columns and each column can have a different value type.  Python `pandas` is therefore ideal for exploring a dataset such as Iris which has 4 numerical columns and 1 string column. 
# 
# `pandas` has several functions for reading tabular data as a `DataFrame` object. 
# `read_csv` loads delimited data from a file, URL or file-like object using a comma as the default delimiter.
# 
# The Iris data set can be read in directly from the url or alternatively it can be saved locally and read in from there. I haved saved it into this project's repository for convenience.
# 
# `pandas.read_csv` performs type inference because the column data types are not part of the data format. Therefore you do not need to specify the data format of each column.
# 
# A `DataFrame` represents a rectangular table of data containing an ordered collection of columns and each column can have a different value type.
# A `DataFrame` has both a row and a column index.
# When the data is imported into python using `pandas.read_csv` function, an index is added to the DataFrame by default. This is a range of numbers from 0 to 150 with the last observation being at index 149.

# READING IN THE IRIS DATA SET

# save url to data and reference the link 
csv_url = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data'

# As the data does not have any column names, specify header = None to avoid reading the first row of data as a header or column name

#iris_data = pd.read_csv(csv_url, header = None)

# I have also saved the csv file to the folder or repository and can read it in from there in case for some reason the url is not available.
#iris = pd.read_csv('iris_data.csv', header =  None)

# using the attribute information as the column names

# ### Exploring the Iris data set
# `pandas.describe()` produces a set of summary statistics for the DataFrame.
# pandas `head()` shows the top 5 observations while `tail()` shows the bottom 5 observations of the dataFrame.
# Tne number of observations to display can be changed by adding an argument to the head and tail functions.

# It is possible to check for missing values in the DataFrame using the panda's `isnull()` method.
# This shows that there are no missing values which is as expected for this well known data set consisting of 150 instances of 5 attributes.

print(iris.describe())


# The initial exploration of the Iris DataFrame shows that there are 150 rows and 5 columns of data. 
# Each row corresponds to an individual observation of an iris plant. The columns show the individual measurements (in centimetres) of the length of the sepal, the length of the petal, the width of the sepal and the width of the petal.
# 
# The mean of the Sepal length is greater than the mean of all the other measurements. 
# The mean of the petal width has the lowest measurements. 
# The standard deviation in the petal lengths shows the highest variability of the four measurements at 1.76 while the standard deviations of the petal width is approx 0.43.
# 
# The shortest petal in the data set is 1 cm while the longest petal is 6.9 cm.
# The widths of the petals vary from 0.1 cm to 2.5 cm.
# The shortest sepal in the data set is 4.3 cm while the longest sepal is 7.9 cm. The narrowest sepal is 2cm while the widest sepal is 4.4 centimetres.
# 

# There are three classes or species of iris flower in this data set. The data set is known to have three classes of iris flower, the Iris Setosa, the Iris Versicolor and the Iris Virginica.
# It is possible to look at each 
#

# Using the `unique()` method to show how many different class or species of Iris flower is in the data set.

iris['Class'].unique()


# As mentioned at the start, the Iris Data Set is a very well known data set found in pattern recognition literature. One class of the Iris flower is linearly separable from the other two classes while the other two classes are not linearly separable from each other.
# 
# The predicted attribute of the data set is the class of Iris plant. 
# Therefore I will look at the statistics for the data set for each class or species.

# pandas has a `groupby` function that can be used to split the Iris data set into groups based on the class or species. Groupwise operatations such as summary statistics, plotting etc can be applied to each group.
# 
# This will keep the entire data set in the one file but operations can be applied to each group and the results will be at group level.
# I could also create subsets of the iris DataFrame for each class or species of Iris plant and then perform the operations on each subset dateFrame.
# 
# [pandas groupby](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html)
# `group by` is a process involving one or more of the following steps:
# 
# - First split the data into groups based on some criteria.
# Split the data into groups and then do something with the individual groups
# 
# - Applying a function to each group independently.
# Aggregation function such as computing summary statistic for each group, group sums or means, group sizes and group counts
# Transformation function to perform some group-specific computations and return a like-indexed object. 
# 
# - Combining the results into a data structure.
# 
# 
# 
# 

# In[19]:


# Using groupby functions to look at statistics at the class / species level
iris_grouped = iris.groupby("Class")

print(iris_grouped.count())


# In[20]:


print(iris_grouped.mean())


# In[57]:


# now looking at the summary statistics for each class of Iris in the data set.
# I transposed the results to make it easier to read.
print(iris_grouped.describe())
iris_grouped.describe().T


# The statistics at the class level show that the average petal length for a Setosa is much smaller at 1.464 cm than the other two classes. The average petal length for the Versicolor is 4.26 while the iris Virginica has the largest average petal length of 5.552 centimetres which is almost four times greater than the petal length of the Iris Setosa.
# The standard deviation of the setosa petal length is quite small compared to the standard deviation of the other two species. This means that the variation around the mean is much smaller than the variation in the other two species.
# 
# The average petal width of the setosa is also much smaller than the average petal width of the other two species. In fact the petal width of the setosa is twelve times smaller than the petal width of the virginica. There is less variability in petal widths in all three species though compared to the variability in the petal length.
# There is not such a large difference between the sepal lengths of the three iris species, although the setosa is again showing the smallest average measurements.
# The average sepal width of the setosa however is actually larger than the averages for the other two species. The average sepal width for the setosa is 3.42 centimetres compared to an average of 2.77 cm for the Versicolor and 2.97 for the virginica. This is also shown in the minimum and maximum measurements for the three species.
# 
# From the summary statistics of the sepal and petal measurements by class type it would seem that the iris setosa is very different from the other two species, the versicolor and the virginica.

# Now instead of looking at the calculations manually I will try adding a column that shows the differences in means between the three species.
# Having used groupby to the get the summary statistics by species, I will add a column to the DataFrame to calculate the differences in means.
# 
# In the original paper by R.A. Fisher,  'THE USE OF MULTIPLE MEASUREMENTS IN TAXONOMIC PROBLEMS' which is available online by The Annals of Human Genetics, Fisher shows a table of the observed means and differences in the means between the iris versicolor and the iris setosa in centimetres.
# This is Table II *Observed means for two species and their difference (cm.)*.
# This table displays the means for each of the 4 measurements for the Iris-Versicolor and Iris-Setosa species. It also shows the differences between the Versicolor means and the Setosa means for each of the 4 measurement variables.
# 
# This table illustrates the observed means and their differences in centimetres. He shows that the length of the Versicolor is on average  2.8 cm's approximately greater than that of the setosa while the sepal length and petal width between these two species vary by approximately one centimetre at 0.93 cm and 1.08 centimetres respectively. On the other hand, the sepal width of the setosa is 0.66 cm larger than that of the versicolor.
# 
# 
# I will try and get the same information in Table II of Fisher's paper.
# 

# In[82]:


# Fisher's table 2 shows the difference in means for the setosa and versicolor species
# use groupby with "Class" variable and then get the mean of each class for each measurement variable.

# create a dataframe from grouping the iris dataframe by class and calculating the means for each class
# Transpose the rows and columns
means = iris.groupby("Class").mean().T
# only getting the columns up to Iris-versicolor to match Table II in Fisher's paper
means.loc[:,'Class':'Iris-versicolor'] 

# Instead of doing it for two species, I will do it for all the three species. 

# add a new column for the difference in means between the Versicolor and Setosa species
means['diff (Versicolor - Setosa)'] = means['Iris-versicolor'] - means['Iris-setosa']

# add a new column for the difference in means between the Versicolor and Virginica species

# add a new column for the difference in means between the Versicolor and Virginica species

# ### where I am!
# I have to leave it for now. I will come back and look more at the differences between the species, then I will look at some plotting. Also look at the correlation between the variables.
