Here I am going to keep some of the things I am removing from the Readme in case I need to put them back in again.
    I know I would be able to see the changes in the files through the git history but this is easier for me at the moment.


Project Task List

#### content tasks
- [x] Research Background information about the Iris data set and summarise it
- [x] List all the references used 
- [x] Download the Iris data set  
- [x] Investigate the Iris data set using python code
- [x] Summarise the Iris data set - provide statistics such as means, minimum and maximum values
- [x] summarise the research a bit better so it not too long or irrelevant
- [x] some information on Edgar Anderson and why he collected the data in the first place.
- [x] a little bit on the linear disciminant function
- [x] show how the linearly separable the data appears to be as noted in the research
- [x] review the plots and highlight the important points
- [x] more plots - looking at seaborn library at the moment. include the images
- [x] consider the machine learning aspect of the iris data set
- [ ] Include examples of interesting analyses that others have pursued based on the data set.
- [ ] look at other python packages outside of pandas, matplotlib and seaborn such as scikit learn 
- [x] Review comments in the python script and make sure they are clear
- [x] look at the print output of the python script
- [ ] Note what I learned from the project, the knowledge and skills gained from completing it and how I went about it.
- [ ] Note how the code and the overall project achieves the goals of the project as per the plan
- [ ] look at how the code can be tested to do as you say it does and produce the correct outputs
- [ ] show the troubleshooting startegies and techniques used to solve problems and document it
- [ ] lessons I have learned from working on this project. Careful closing out of Jupyter notebooks!!
- [ ] find out how to print using multiple separators for `print("The column labels of the iris DataFrame are: ", *iris.columns, sep = "   ")`
- [ ] 

#### organisation and presentation tasks
- [ ] review the layout of the readme
- [ ] maybe move all the plots out of the main python script - instead I am saving the plot output to png files rather than displaying each one to the screen
- [ ] possibly move some code from the readme. redirect the script output to a text file and save that to the repository
- [ ] table of contents. numbering. not all links are working
- [ ] keep the jupyter notebook in line with the python script and readme document. will come back to this after the project due date as it not necessary for now
- [x] get links to images working. sizing works with html tags
- [ ] Ensure the project is well organised and contain detailed explanations throughout

Table II in Fisher's paper is entitled *Observed means for two species and their difference (cm.)*
This table displays the means for each of the 4 measurements for the Iris-Versicolor and Iris-Setosa species. It also shows the differences between the Versicolor means and the Setosa means for each of the 4 measurement variables.

### Correlation between variables.
Correlation is a statistical method used to determine whether a linear relationship between variables exists. It shows if one variable tends to occur with large or small values of another variable. It calculates a number *r* between -1 and + 1 where the number (the correlation coefficient) indicates the strength of the relationship and the sign indicates whether that relationship is positive or negative. The correlation coefficient does not depend on the units of measurement or on which variable is on the x or y axis. 
(In the case of the Iris data set, the measurements are all in the same units anyway as they are provided in centimetres.)
The correlation statistics are computed from  pairs of arguments.
The correlation of the measurements can be got using the `corr` method on the DataFrame. If there is a strong positive relationship beytween the variables, the value of the correlation coefficient *r* will be close to 1, while a strong negative relationship will have a correlation coefficient *r* close to -1. A vlaue of *r* close to zero would indicate that there is no relationship between the variables.

A scatter plot is used to visualise the relationship between two variables. It is a graph of the ordered pairs of two variables. One variable is plotted on the x-axis while the other variable is plotted on the y-axis.

~~The `DataFrame` method `duplicated` can be used to see if any of the rows in the data set are duplicates of another row. I am just using it to see if there are any individual observations that have the exact same measurements as another observation.~~

~~There are three observations which appear to have the same measurements as other observations in the dataset as follows. It is possible that these values may have been rounded at some stage when or since the dataset was put together in 1936.~~
